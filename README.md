# INFO202-Project
A fully functional online shopping system. Developed the full front and back end during INFO202.

The project is an online shopping system that allows the businessâ€™s staff to add new products to the system and search, filter, view, update and delete those products. All information is stored in a persistent database.
The web application allows customers to register and sign in with an account, in order to browse and purchase products from the business.
